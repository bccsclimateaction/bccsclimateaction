        <h2 class="drop-in">Climate Change: A Global Challenge with Local Solutions</h2>
        <p id="author" class="drop-in-2">by Umer Ahmad</p>
        <div id="articletext">
            <p class="drop-in-3"><strong>Climate change is a major global issue that affects nearly everything on planet earth,</strong> whether its living or non-living, human or plant. Its consequences, ranging from extreme temperatures to increases in both magnitude and frequency of natural disasters, among others discussed later, are a major threat to the planet and the life on it. However, with timely and efficient use of solutions, the crisis can be averted.</p>
            <p class="drop-in-4">Climate change right now is <strong>primarily due to human activities</strong> The major factor is an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. These gases reradiate emitted infrared radiation from the planet, thus heating the planet up. Examples include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapour, and nitrous oxides.</p>
            <p class="drop-in-4">Firstly, using <strong>fossil fuels</strong> e.g coal, oil, and natural gas for heating, transportation, and energy, releases carbon dioxide and methane into the air</p>
            <p>Secondly, <strong>large-scale deforestation</strong> for raw materials e.g wood or to make space for agriculture or urbanisation also leads to an increase in carbon dioxide levels, as trees play a key role in reducing the amount of carbon dioxide, by absorbing it during photosynthesis.</p>
            <p>Last but not the least, certain industrial and agricultural processes release greenhouse gases as waste. This is especially problematic when the waste is not cleaned to reduce its impact on the environment. The methane released by cows and other livestock is one of the largest sources of methane. </p>
            <p>Climate change has a multitude of far-reaching consequences that impact entire ecosystems, economies, and environments. These effects manifest at both local and global scales.</p>
            <p>Locally, extreme weather events occur more and with increased severity. <strong>Hurricanes, droughts, floods, and wildfires</strong> disrupt and destroy communities, ecosystems, and livelihoods. The recent wildfire in Maui, Hawaii is a great example. Due to a severe drought beforehand, the wildfire has become the US’s deadliest in more than 100 years. Additionally, heatwaves negatively affect agriculture, public health, and overall comfort.</p>
            <p>Globally speaking, the melting of ice caps and glaciers has contributed greatly to <strong>increasing sea levels</strong>, which threaten coastal communities and infrastructure. Moreover, these also contain massive amounts of carbon dioxide, which then leads to increasing temperatures, hence producing a feedback loop that would be devastating if not taken care of urgently. Besides this, weather patterns also become more unpredictable, affecting agriculture and water resources on a massive scale.</p>
            <p>Addressing climate change requires collaborative efforts on local and global fronts. Locally, local efforts to plant trees and conserve natural habitats to reduce carbon dioxide and protect biodiversity should be supported. Awareness for <strong>recycling and responsible waste management</strong> should be conducted, along with installment of the proper waste management infrastructure needed for this.</p>
            <p>On an international level, There should be promotion and investment in renewable energy sources such as <strong>solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.</strong> Global agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions play a key role, such as ‘The Paris Agreement’ or the carbon neutral goal by 2050 of the European Union. Countries should cooperate on and work together on potential solutions to address climate issues.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, climate change is a critical issue that transcends borders and affects everyone. Its causes are deeply rooted in human activities, but solutions exist at both local and international levels. By taking action in our communities, supporting renewable energy, and advocating for global cooperation, we can work together to combat climate change and secure a sustainable future for our planet.</p>
            <p>As students, we have a crucial role to play in raising awareness and driving positive change. <strong>The time is now to take action</strong>, before it becomes too late to do so and the damage to the planet becomes irreversible and future generations suffer from the mistakes of their ancestors.</p>
